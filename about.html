        <h1>Roofing Expertise, Genuine Care</h1>
            <p>We know the roofing industry is a racket. That's why we set out to change it. 
            You deserve a company who has exceptional knowledge of their craft while providing
            the same service you would receive at your local mom and pop stores. And so, Sanders
            and Sanders Roofing was born.</p>
    

    <p>From small beginnings....</p>
    <p>Will Purvis spend hot Mississippi summers in high school on a roof with his stepdad
    learning the craft of installing roofs. Nearly fifteen years later, he knew he could take
    the small one man operation and turn it into something that could change the lives of 
    his family and community. In 2016, Sanders and Sanders Roofing would open in Clinton, MS and become officially
    licensed with the <a href="http://search.msboc.us/Detail.cfm?ContractorID=48379&ContractorType=Residential&varDataSource=BOCRes&Advanced=0">
    Mississippi State Board of Contractors</a> and a legacy would be created.</p>

    <p>Expansion Meets Community</p>
    <p>In 2019, Will saw an opportunity to expand from the original location in 
    central Mississippi and opened the second location in Gulfport, MS. When Hurricane Zeta surprised the Gulf Coast in October of 2020,
    Sanders and Sanders Roofing would stand out as an honest local company in a sea of pop- 
    up roofing companies looking to make a buck.</p>

    <p>We are proud to maintain a reputation that allows for over 40%
    of our monthly business to come from customer referrals.</p>
