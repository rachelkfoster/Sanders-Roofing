        <h3> SHINGLE</h3>
        <p class="shingle">All of our shingle roofs are installed to manufacture AND local standards. This 
        protects your home from the elements of coastal living. We use
        GAF Timberline HDZ&reg; architectural shingles, the #1 best-selling shingle in the market.
        We strictly adhere to local building codes and manufacturer instructions when installing your
        roof to ensure you don't have to worry about your home being protected from the unpredictable
        Mississippi weather</p>

        <h3>METAL</h3>
        <p class="metal">Aesthetically pleasing and built to last. Metal roofs are an excellent option
        for those who want to protect their forever home for the long-haul.</p>
        <p><img src="GettyImages-163052119.jpg" alt="Corrugated Roof" height="200px" width="200px"/> <strong>Corrugated metal</strong> is the most common type of metal roof, often called a "tin roof" in the south. These exposed
        fastner roofs have a longer lifespan than shingle roofs and are commonly considered more durable
        against strong weather systems.</p>
        
        <p><img src="GettyImages-1153586605.jpg" alt="Standing Seam Metal Roof" height="200px" width="200px"/> <strong>Standing seam metal roofs</strong> 
        have a more modern, high-end appearance. They offer 
        a beautiful finish and supreme weather-proofing due to their concealed fastener design.</p>
