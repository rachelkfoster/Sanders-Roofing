        target="_blank">Sanders and Sanders did a fantastic job. Arrived early and were completed at the end of the day. Even when the supplier sent the wrong 
        product, Will and his site supervisors pivoted and made it happen. Would highly recommend.</a></q></p>

        target="_blank">Roof installation was completed on 26 July 2024. Roof ordered was a fortified roof. This involved considerably more work 
        by the roofers. They did a professional job and left the area as clean as it was before they started. After completion, the fortified roof inspector 
        submitted his report to the fortified office, and I received my Hurricane Fortified Roof designation (certificate) on 17 Sep. 2024. I feel the price 
        was outstanding for the serviced rendered. I am well pleased and would recommend this company.</a></q></p>

        <p class="customer"><q><a class="review-quote" href="https://www.facebook.com/dyson.taylor/posts/10225415305385654" target="_blank">I highly recommend Sanders and 
        Sanders roofing. They squeezed me in super quick and replaced my entire roof in a day and a half. 
        I am in love with the results! They are incredibly easy to communicate with and they also cleaned my yard up great afterwards. No stray roof nails to 
        be found. You will not regret working with them!</q></p>

        Sanders replaced my roof recently.  Even worked into the night to get it done. Their supervisors explained everything to me while
        the work was underway. My neighbors comment on how good it looks. I highly recommend this company.</a></q></p>
